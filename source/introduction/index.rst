Introduction
============

Documentation is an essential part of any project. Whether youâ€™re creating user guides, API documentation, or developer manuals, having well-structured and easy-to-read documentation is crucial. This is where **reStructuredText** (`.rst`) files come in.

What is reStructuredText?
--------------------------

**reStructuredText (reST)** is a lightweight, plain-text markup language designed for creating documentation. It is commonly used with tools like **Sphinx** to generate professional-looking HTML, PDF, and ePub documents. With its simple syntax, `.rst` makes it easy to write and maintain clear documentation.

Why Use .rst Files?
-------------------

Here are some reasons why `.rst` files are popular for documentation:

- **Readable and Clean**: The plain-text format ensures that your content remains readable without complex markup.
- **Sphinx Compatibility**: `.rst` works seamlessly with **Sphinx** to generate beautifully formatted documentation.
- **Customizable**: You can use themes, add images, code snippets, and tables of contents with minimal effort.
- **Cross-Platform**: It supports generating documentation in multiple formats like HTML, PDF, and ePub.
