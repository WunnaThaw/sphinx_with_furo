Prerequisites
==============

Before you get started with creating and managing `.rst` files using Sphinx, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Python Installed
-------------------

- Sphinx is a Python-based tool, so you need Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- You can check your Python version using:

::

    > python --version

2. pip Installed 
---------------------

- `pip` is the Python package manager required to install Sphinx and other extensions.
- Verify `pip` installation with:

::

     > pip --version

3. Sphinx Installed
------------------------ 

- Install Sphinx using `pip`:

::

     > pip install sphinx

4. Basic Knowledge of reStructuredText
---------------------------------------

Familiarity with `.rst` syntax is helpful. You should understand basic concepts like:

- Headings
- Lists
- Code Blocks
- Links and Images

5. A Code Editor
---------------------

- Use any text editor like **Visual Studio Code**, **Sublime Text**, or **Notepad++**.  
- A code editor with reStructuredText support will be helpful for syntax highlighting.

6. A Project Directory
-----------------------

- Create a working directory for your documentation files:

::

     > mkdir my-docs
     > cd my-docs

Once these prerequisites are met, you’re ready to start building your documentation using `.rst` files and Sphinx. 🎉
